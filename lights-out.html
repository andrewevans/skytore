I wanted to tell my roommates the hilarious night I had, but they were still asleep. I needed my rest too, so I passed out like a log.

I woke up a few hours later to the cackling of gunfire and explosions. It was a battlefield. Battlefield Reset Expansion Pack, to be exact. It was time to get up.

"You fuckin snatch face!", Francis yelled at his glass monitor with one hand on the keys and the other sliding across the screen. "Nah nah, I kid I kid. What up Ander," he said as he welcomed me to the new day without breaking his concentration from his monitor. "Did you gather that intel you were looking for last night? How'd it go?"

"Dude it was awesome. I met this girl and her friend and I think I kissed her friend. I don't know." I tried to recount what exactly had happened. "It was like a dream I swear."

"Niiiice," he said in a congratulatory tone as he took his headset and gamer glasses off, and slurped up the last of his Cocoa Pits.

The shower was a brief 20 minutes as I pieced together the night before. Some of it seemed real, and some of it seemed like I had dreamt it in my car. I toweled up and wiped the fog from the mirror. The reflection revealed a small vertical incision a couple inches long on my chest, heart-side. It looked manmade. Or womanmade, although those were usually on my back.

I suited up for the coldness swirling around my stand up desk and got back to work. It was in good working condition; a user's movement could be tracked by the app, they could mark a geographical area as theirs, and could reap the virtual goods in that area.

The end goal of Rose Garden was to encourage less fortunate areas of the country to become more lucrative by giving players more prestige for literally building, or helping build, or being frequent visitors to, real libraries, recreation centers, authentic food joints, or to improve upon already existing socially positive businesses in places that would have otherwise gone ignored. One milestone of success was for a nearby slum to increase its schools' educational ratings by 25% within the next three years by actions directly caused by Rose Garden. It was a feat nearly impossible to accomplish, but I was confident that if I could get the funding and interest in this app that we would see a Las Vegas-type of growth in places that were not expected to succeed.

Popular places that were already succeeding, like California's Silicon Valley, would be saturated in players trying to reap the rewards of those establishments, but the abundance of players in that area would water down each player's gain, encouraging them to look into more obscure areas, like low-income neighborhoods.

We hopped in Francis’s car and headed to the new shawarma place on College Ave. His car stereo turned on blaring a commercial about a ventriloquist named "Gabo" coming to town, followed by a permanent flow of nonsensical radio personality voices.

I ordered the classic shawarma from the beefy Greek woman behind the counter and took a seat near the window. I put the change into my wallet and saw a card with a Joker's head on it. I froze. The Joker's face even kind of looked like that magic guy from the night before. No contact info, just the words:

GABØ

Living Ventriloquist Extraordinaire

"Dude, check this out!" I began to hand Francis the card before he was even half way to the table.

"Gabo!" he said. "Gabo's coming to town. I heard about this on the AM radio."

"I met this guy last night," I explained.

"You met the clown on the Joker card or you met Gabo the dummy? Either way, that's pretty cool."

"No, it was some showman guy, like the kind you see at a carnival sideshow. He wasn't doing ventriloquist stuff. He stole my wallet." I knew my words made little sense, but it was difficult to describe quickly.

"He put this in my wallet, but I forgot he said that. Then I told him that there was an ass in his --" I stopped my vulgarity just as the Greek woman brought us our order. "He's one of Celeste's friends. Celeste is the girl from last night."

"Good job, man," he said. "I think the radio said he'll be at The Trough tonite."

I checked the internet when we got home and sure enough, Gabo was doing a gig at The Trough. 8pm. I needed to get as much work done before then to ensure meeting my deadline. Rose Garden had to be a "Minimum Viable Product" by Monday morning or the investors would second guess my team's ability to deliver in a timely fashion.

Most of the necessary game mechanics were in place for a very rudimentary version of the game. I had tied into Google Maps for landmarks and business locations, public municipal tax documents for revenue gains and losses, US census data for population density, Foursquare for popularity of places, local police crime reports, and a handful of manual entries for statistics like education and health ratings.

For a game like this, it wasn't always clear what to set certain constants to, like how many beacons a user starts with to lay claim to areas, or how much reputation a user earns, but these were all adjustable once we got our beta group playing the game and churning through the algorithms. Some aspects were simple, like less crime meant more points. Other aspects were very subjective, like what more churches should earn an area, or whether more bars was good or bad. It was clearly skewed to my personal beliefs, but all of that was adjustable once we saw it in action.

Most of the game was played on a map interface, and the important ever-evolving What Now list would alert the user to future developments that were underway. What Now showcased large developments like government projects and recent business licenses purchased, as well as future local gatherings like music shows and farmers’ markets that businesses could manually post themselves. Players could use this list to help them place their beacons near developments that they thought would be successful, even if just for a short period of time.

One of the biggest missing components was whether the game had a victory for a player, or if it went on indefinitely. And what were the real-world rewards? I intentionally left those questions unanswered because of their complexity, and also to leave it open-ended so that the investors could chat about those components and then hire Sociologists to fine-tune the game. I was also excited that I might even be able to create jobs for Sociologists!

The night had begun. Francis and I lit up our spliffs and began the walk to The Trough.

"What are you going to do if she's there?" Francis inquired.

"Play it off like I remember everything and it was a great party," I replied.

"What if she's jonesing for me?" His half-witted remark lacked the sarcasm it should have been delivered with.

"You go after her friend, or at least keep her friend busy," I answered. "She's fly and kind of a firecracker."

"Didn't you already kiss her friend?"

"Not really," I explained the Lady and the Tramp moment with the whiskey drink, and then went on to detail the rest of that night that I could remember.

We found a good spot at the bar that was close to the stage.

A few minutes later, the lights dimmed, and one of the bartenders spoke into the mic.

"Without further ado, Gabo!" the announcer said as he clapped in Gabo emerging from the darkness behind him.

He was dressed in the typical ventriloquist outfit with his striped shirt and light blue blazer. He introduced himself as Gabo, and gave a few complimentary words to the crowd. From a white box with red polka dots, he produced a wooden dummy, dressed just like him. "I'd like you all to meet Gabo." I found it odd that he and the dummy bore the same name. With his hand already buried underneath the back of the doll's shirt, it began to cough.

"*cough cough* Thanks for letting me out of that box," the dummy's nasal voice complained. "Who are all these people? I thought you said we were going to the…"

I didn't come here to see a grown man talk to a doll. I came here to find my lady in the red dress. I scanned the room for a red dress, then realized that she was most likely not still wearing a red dress.

"OK, she's pretty tall, really blonde, pouty lips, I don't know what else," I told Francis.

"What about her friend?"

"Not as tall, brunette. She had that sinister cat eyes eye-liner when I saw her. And bangs."

"Melody, right?" he asked.

"Yup."

We both looked around the room for a minute, but to no avail. I told Francis there was no guarantee they would be here. I didn't even know where they lived. Either way, we were going to enjoy our Belgian beers and have a good time.

When I looked at the audience through my Squarecam, there were dozens of artistic Squarememes floating around the venue. There were a couple of transparent colorful unicorns prancing around the tops of everyone’s heads, clearly made by a very skilled artist, and a few people with the usual animal heads in place of their own. Sights like those where so many memes were condensed in a small area and interacting with one another made the real world seem so dull. When I put the phone away I noticed that most of the crowd was actually just wearing their customary all-black wardrobes.

"Oh shit. I almost forgot to check in," I mentioned to Francis as I booted up Foursquare. The app was still on Celestival's profile.

"See if she checked in here," Francis suggested as he looked at my phone curiously.

"Good idea," I replied. He was right. She had checked in a minute ago. I felt the giddiness overwhelm me. With this full house, I figured that meant she was probably still near the door.

"Oh snap!" Francis says as he motions his head toward the door. There she is, looking right at us, showing a bit of excitement herself.

I immediately get up and shimmy my way through the crowd to greet her. "Celeste, funny to see you here." I tried to hide my anxiety with a stupid comment like that as we hugged.

"Really?" she replies. "Actually it's funny to see *you* here. Hi Andrew."

"Come sit with me and my friend over at the bar," I say as I point toward Francis who nods back. We make our way to our seats, Francis getting up like a gentleman to let her sit.

After a few introductory comments we focus back on the show. Right when she spun her barstool to face the stage, Gabo the dummy looked at her and raised one eyebrow. I thought to myself, *I'd better not get outdone by a talking doll*.

I waited a few minutes to ask her, to make it seem like I was enjoying the show, which I was, "So is Melody with you?" Francis and I both held our breaths for her answer.

"Oh you remember Melody!" she says happily. "She'll be here in a few minutes. Save a spot for her. Where's the restroom?"

"It's behind the stage," I reply as I point to the hall behind where Gabo was performing. She slips off the barstool in her skin-tight jeans and makes her way to the restrooms. While Gabo the dummy was in the middle of one of his bits, he follows her with his eyes, step for step, to the point where his head is turned all the way around when she finally gets to the restroom door.

"Oo la la!" the dummy remarks at Celeste. She waves at him and closes the door behind her. The crowd laughs. I pretend to laugh.

"Niiiice," Francis says in approval.

"Melody's fly too," I assure him.

"She better not be with some dude."

"If she is, we'll scare him off." I assure him again. "We're good at that."

A few minutes and a couple drinks had passed.

"Silly!" a girl's voice excitedly rings out. Celeste gives Melody a strong hug as if they hadn't seen each other for a long time. Melody then turns to me. "I remember you."

"Hi," I say. We give each other a quick hug, just long enough to qualify as a hug, with about a football field's distance in between us.

"And?" She questions.

"And... I missed you?" I question back.

"Aaaand, this must be your friend Francix." as she looks over my shoulder at Francis who wore a grin ear to ear.

"Hahahaha," he chuckles. "Greetings."

"How did you know him?" I ask.

She keeps her gaze on him as she answers. "Foursquare. Duh."

"Ahahaha," Francis chuckles again, as if he is a wind up toy with two lines.

"Let's get another round," I suggest. Everyone was on board.

The night went smoothly, and I successfully dodged any mention of Rose Garden. Gabo joined our quatro after his performance, shared a couple jokes, got some kisses on the cheeks from the girls, and was off. He had another show the next afternoon and needed his rest. I'm pretty sure he recognized me. Right before he exited, he shouted at the bartender "Cory!" Gabo pointed at us with four fingers, then made a square motion, then pointed to himself. The bartender nodded and waved to him goodbye.

The bartender walked over to us and said, "Drinks are on your friend." The girls looked at each other with puppy dog eyes and exhaled every last bit of breath they had in their lungs in astonishment.

"Hahahaha", Francis laughs.

The whole night I couldn't decide if I should chat up Celeste like I wanted to or extract Foursquare secrets from her. She was sharp and on her toes, though. So juicing an orange without the orange knowing would not be easy.

She worked in Foursquare's Game Theory department, which meant she was one of a handful of people who created features in the app’s core mechanics. She would know the secrets of how the app flowed behind the scenes, what worked and what didn't, and how to *cause* the users to do what they wanted them to do. It was clear they were creating playful rivalries between users, but in recent time the app started recommending strange actions, like checking into natural disasters before they happened and reward the user generously for being there.

"Your hair looks cute in a bun like that," I say.

"You think?" Celeste says as she studies me for veracity and tightens the bun up even more.

Out of the corner of my eye I can see Francis taking Melody's hand as he leads her to the dance floor. There was a female vocalist that had taken the stage a few minutes before. She’s singing some kickass original rock'n'roll jams with her raspy soulful voice.

"You know what else I think?" I ask.

"What?" she asks back as she pounds the last of her drink and grabs my hand in haste, pulling me toward the dance floor.

"My thoughts exactly," I say, slightly disappointed that she beat me to my own punchline.

When the tatt'ed out singer chick wrapped up her set, so did we. On the street in front of The Trough I exchanged numbers with Celeste, and Melody and Francis the same. Finally.

The walk home was the usual debriefing of "I did this then I did that I should have done this should I have done that".

"Still no intel. Fuck." I spat on the ground.

"She's on her game, bro," Francis replied. "She avoided all of your questions about details on that shit. She's on to you."

"You think?" I asked.

"Doesn't matter," he said.

"Doesn't matter," I agreed.

The last bit of the walk home was silent, with both of our heads held high wading in our separate pools of victory. It was a successful night, and it was just the beginning.

The Sky Tore
============

I hope us Bay Area ready for some cats & dogs & men. This weekend. Oh, Basement!

>Check-in [ander]
@ The Trough

The sky tore open to reveal its dark electric internals, a rift in time and space. It made no sense but there it was. I knew that whatever was happening was irreversible. Beyond fear of death of myself or anyone I loved, I felt a fear that whatever I was seeing was more powerful than my mind could understand, and more powerful than this world was able to handle. Clearly. The sky was tearing apart. I saw the history of existence coming to an end. This could actually be the end of the end of the end.

The burnt curls on the edges of the soon-to-be destroyed sky were peeling away slowly as if our universe was paper, and this wrath was the flame. I felt a cool deathly wind begin to cover my skin. Was it real or was it just my fright? At this point, nothing was real or unreal, really. My mind came back to reality to visit my worldly concerns: is Celeste ok? I pulled my eyes off of the ripping universe to see if there was a danger beyond the obvious inevitable oblivion that could hurt Celeste. She was also transfixed on the sky. A light hail of tiny silver icicles hit the dirt field that we stood upon. They were so sharp that they stood erect on the ground after incising the earth. She noticed me looking at her with bewilderment. Her gaze back at me, though, was one that was all too clear: she was ready to say goodbye. No. Not a human nor nature nor God herself was allowed to harm her. This could not be. And it will not be.

Don't say goodbye. I am more powerful than you know, my dear Celeste. And now is when I will show you, now is when the sands of time have reared their vengeful face and it is nothing to me. You are everything. It's not those words that speak so sweetly in books and movies and songs, or those places that are so beautiful that a smile and silence are the only response. It is not that lust that I have for you every waking moment, for your perfect body, with those calligraphic curves, your toned complexion, your legs that go on forever, your unreal face that was crafted with the most expert precision, your expressions that leave me speechless when you say so much with no words at all, your soft pouty lips, flowing blonde hair that fucking glows. There is something now that I realize that must continue, and that is you. Within you holds a compassion and a beauty that this ending world knows it cannot do without. Is that what is happening right now? The cosmos is about to lose you so it has decided to self destruct?

* * *

"I'm trying to be cordial, dumb dumb", she replies when I asked her why she just courtsied the bellboy. Her crimson dress was the exact color of freshly oxygenated blood. Her drink was a layered gold and orange and red Mai Tai that matched nicely with her dress and her cherry lip gloss. The night sky with the warm subtle outdoor lighting was making her image all the more majestic. It was a little over the top, but then again everything about her was.

"I'm sure he appreciated it", I say with a smug smile implying that she was still being silly regardless. "A red dress at a cocktail gala, kind of devilish don't you think?"

"It's not my fault all the other girls are wearing black", she says.

>Check-in [ander] @ The GLA

"I guess it's just --", I try to explain before she cuts me off.

>-Check-in [ander]
@ The da bears

"But, shhhh", she leans in and tells me. "It's what's under my dress that's best."

"Uh, well yeah, but -- ", again I can't finish my sentence.

"No, you dog."

"I'm not a dog."

>When are you getting here? I've been waiting for like 20 minutes. Hurry up. There was a cool magician guy walking around throwing stuff though. *Anyways, I'm here.*

"No, I mean look," still with her voice lowered so only I can hear. She hikes up her dress upon her right leg just enough so I can see what she has strapped to her thigh.

"What the fuck? Is that a flask?", I'm so confused.

"It's like Jessica Rabbit", she proclaims as she tries to hide her giggles, as if she's done something so clever.

"You do know it's an open bar, right?", I level with her. "This mansion party is sponsored by Foursquare. You know, that company you work for?"

She looks at me with an empty stare as if she's waiting for me to speak even though I just did.

"And Jessica Rabbit? I don't remember her packing a flask," I say as I try again to understand where this girl's coming from. "What's your name anyways?"

"Celeste. And you drew a picture of Jessica Rabbit and she had a flask on her hip just like this." She shows me again the strapped flask.

"How -- what -- I mean I did but how did you see that? That was like 10 years ago. I'm Andrew by the way."

"I know."

"You know. Yeah you do know... somehow. Alright I'm confused can I take a pull from your flask? It'll help me get more disoriented."

She looks sly and away, then produces the flask from under her dress, and hands it to me while still looking paranoidly toward the large double doors of the castle-like structure that we are standing outside of.

I grab it from her extended hand very obviously and fearlessly, because I know nobody gives a shit. The liquor, kind of warm, tastes like whiskey. Irish whiskey.

"Mmmm hooo ouw yeah", I exclaim from its sharp flavor, mostly due to its warmth. I look at her to hand it back. She's looking right into my eyes to see if I abide.

"Yeah?", she asks.

"Yeah, definitely." I hand it back to her as I wipe the wetness from my lips. "Jessica Rabbit, huh?"

"You sound surprised." She leans against a railing that separates us from some sort of cliff, the night’s darkness making it impossible for me to see what's below. She dangles the flask in her hand nonchalantly, contradicting her original paranoid glances.

"I drew that once in college and I don't even know where it is anymore," I explain. "Where did you go to college?" She names off a university I've never heard of or couldn't recollect, nor did I really care.

"Is that a Mai Tai? That's my favorite," I say, trying to move the conversation away from the trippy convo of past art I made that somehow she knows about.

"Yeah. You like chick drinks."

"Yup," I admit. "I also like chicks."

"What kind?"

"The best kind."

"You're stupid," she replies, looking at me as if I'm to say something clever after that. Everything about her was clever or stupid, I couldn't tell which. But I liked it. If it wasn't for her Jessica Rabbit comments, I'd simply be attracted to her, but she derailed that emotion with her odd behavior. But I liked that too.

There was an almost awkward silence for a bit, but I was ok with it because it gave me a chance to judge her, up and down, her dress, her striking appearance, her tipsiness, her glowing hair.

"Foursquare's tight," I say, trying again to have a normal conversation with her.

"I love Foursquare!" she says, as if I mentioned something original, despite the fact that we were clearly at a Foursquare-hosted event. "Let's be friends."

"Yeah let's. And we are. Now."

"On Foursquare dumb dumb." She pulls out her phone and taps the screen a few times.

We tapped our phones together and less than a second later my phone chirped with a message letting me know she had found me, connected with me, and now knew everywhere I had been in the past few years. But then again, she already knew me, somehow.

We both dove into our phones, digging into each other's lives via an app that lets people narcissistically track *themselves* wherever they go. The app had matured a lot in the past year, though. It not only offered a historical footprint of the places the user had been, but suggested where they should go next. And I needed to figure out how it does that. Maybe she knew. Maybe she was enough sheets to the wind to let some secrets slip.

“Everything we do now is like a footprint, written into history,” I say.

“It’s more like a blueprint,” she says. “Put it all together and you can... build things.”

She'd been to a bar near the convention center we were all just at. She'd been to a carnival. Paris. Milan. And then a bunch of other things that didn’t exactly register with the app. There's strange characters for the names at geographic locations that I've never heard of. Probably some sort of insider Foursquare stuff, I figure.

"Paris is so awesome," I say as to relate to her. "I was there once for a couple of days." I wish I had something better to say than just "I've been there" but nothing surfaces in my brain.

I brought the phone up to face the app’s camera on her to see if I could get any useful information from the image it would create. The app added a sparkling glisten to her dress and made her hair bright red. It added a knife strapped to her leg just above the flask holster. It was my drawing from years ago. Foursquare’s Squarecam had added the handful of enhancements to her appearance to make her appear as my Jessica Rabbit drawing. I shook my head in disbelief and put my phone away. Foursquare had noticed a similarity to the girl in front of me and a piece of art I made, and animated it on her person through the camera.

She rigged the flask back into its holster. "I'm gonna go back inside," she said while resetting her dress back to appropriate length.

I felt worried that she was going to get away from me, but I wasn't sure that I cared all that much. "Wait." I try to hide the urgency in my voice but it was too late.

"For what?" she says condescendingly.

"For me." I had a spliff when I went outside and that's why I went outside but somehow it was gone. I didn't remember finishing it or smothering its ashes. It was just gone.

I take a few steps toward the mansion and extend my arm in a motion to suggest that she wrap hers around mine. Nervous because I was giving her the opportunity to shoot me down outright, but even moreso I felt confident and determined. I wasn't going to let her get away. Not yet.

Without hesitation she wraps her arm around mine. I give her a nod, and she half a smile to me.

We entered the main entrance together. A white cat casually passed by my feet, smoothing its coat on my pant, and it eased my tension. The white cat's gaze told me "You, you're good, continue on". I watched him disappear into the dense crowd along the edges of the main walkway. It's like the guests had preemptively cleared a path for me and Celeste, and there was even a red carpet for fucks sake. A tall man notices us near the entrance, then brings his attention back to his cocktail dressed date, pretending he didn't give me that "damn how did you snag that?" look. It causes me a sly grin.

Her walk was proud and leading, her chest could not have been postured more pronounced. Several girls do the up-and-down look at her, then a fraction of a look at me. The usual.

"Ugh", she sighed, maybe in reference to those chicks' judgment stares. "Anyways, do you like magic?"

"Yeah for sure!" I exclaim, because I love magic. "What kind?"

"The best kind", she says in a deeper voice to let me know she was mocking my earlier identical statement. "I think I know where it is."

As we were walking to the main ballroom, not 10 feet away from it, she slid our linked arms into us holding hands as she led me down a large hall to the parlor. There was laughter and clapping beaming through the corridor. She was so far in front of me, pulling me, that I could see the fitness in her arm, and an ass to match.

"These are my friends!", her voice much more high pitched and excited. The first thing I noticed in the room was the whiley gentleman who stood in front of a burning fireplace surrounded by five or so guests absorbing his show. Did he just pull an Ace from behind someone's ear? Yes he did. They clapped and laughed.

"Celeste!", the showman belted upon first sight of her. "Sit down, sit down. We're just getting started. And your friend, he is welcome too." He gestured with both hands for us to sit in an empty section of the giant leather lounge couch. "And what do you call yourself?", he asked me as he put his hand on my lower back to hurry me to sit. A little too low if you ask me.

"The fuck?"

"You call yourself 'The Fuck'?" he gayly snapped back at me with that carnival sideshow grin.

"What, well, no. I mean, I should, but... I'm Andrew.", feeling glad I was even able to finish my sentence.

"Alright Andrew, may I use you in my next trick?"

"Sure thing."

"Andrew, how much money do you have in your wallet?" he asked.

"Plenty."

"No, Andrew, that is incorrect. You have no money in your wallet. In fact, you don't even have a wallet!" The crowd laughed. I pressed my pocket and it wasn't there. That son of a bitch. "But that's ok, I'll give it back to you. My card’s inside, thanks for playing!"

The slight humiliation stung, and in front of Celeste no less. I felt I needed to earn a couple points back, and at his expense. I just had to wait for the right moment.

"Silly!", a cocktail poptart (girl) yelped from the hallway. "I've been looking all over for you, girl." She cut right in the middle of the performance and grabbed Celeste's non-drinking hand. So quickly she whisked her up and away. Celeste didn't hesitate.

I lifted myself up to follow, but not too quickly that my intentions be so obvious. Sideshow guy noticed my departure, and attempted one last jab. "And hey buddy," he began. "If you find an Ace in your wallet, it wasn't me ahahaha!" The crowd laughed again, on cue, as they always did.

"Oh and hey buddy", I replied. I turned around right before the hallway to face everyone, with my arms shrugging. "And if you find an ass in your cock, it wasn't me ahahaha!"

All jaws dropped, all smiles gone. Sideshow looked especially teary-eyed.

"Andrew!" Celeste yelled unimpressed from down the hall. Apparently I was right behind those girls.

Trying to save face, I point at the closest girl sitting in front of me. "It was her!" They all laughed!

Celeste had held her friend back waiting for me. She looked at me with surprise, but her smile still shown through. She liked it. I jogged down the hall to meet them. I heard the tapping of fork to glass as the crowd headed toward the main ballroom.

"Shoot, I need a drink." I muttered to myself and kind of to Celeste. "Bar's all the way across the room." The room was too packed to get through without being a jerk. She looked at me like 'come on', and did that sly surveying with her eyes as she leaned down to pretend to fix her heal. I could see her friend to her right, the one who whisked her away. She actually looked really good now, unlike before when she was stealing my project.

Celeste returned to position and handed me the flask. "An open bar's not so open if you can't --", she moved closer to whisper, "-- fucking get to it."

I nodded to show my submissive agreement. She grabbed the empty glass from her friend's hand and gave it to me. "Silly!" her friend yelped again in the same intonation as before.

"You two can share", Celeste explained as she repositioned herself so that her friend was now in between us. "This is Melody."

"Hi I'm Melody," she says.

"I'm Andrew. Pleasure to meet you. Can I make you a drink and share it with you?"

"Sure what is it?" she asks.

"It's a fine Irish whiskey, warmed nicely on Celeste's leg, mixed with nothing, served in a champagne flute." She giggles. I pour.

"Thank you, kind sir," she replies in an overly polite voice, keeping with the little skit we were doing. I hand her the glass, but instead of taking it from me, she grips the stem over my fingers so that I can't let go. Her closer arm wraps around the back of my neck and pulls me toward her. With the drink between us, she raises it, and I raise it too. "Cheers," she says as we smile at each other. She tilts the glass slightly more toward me, implying that I was to take the first sip. But then her plan unfolds. She brings her lips adjacent to mine like the glass is a mic and we are a duet. The whiskey would have fallen through the space between, so, naturally, we both complete the seal on the bottom of the glass by moving our whiskey-loving puckers as to just slightly touch one another's. And this is no simple whiskey shot. She forces the tilt of the glass so that the entire flute full of whiskey pours out equally for the both of us.

She lets go of the glass causing me to almost drop it. I wince at the sharp warm flavor, and she does too. I felt like I was blushing.

But wait, had I just kissed Celeste's friend?

"Don't worry," Melody whispers to me. "I'm not trying to kiss you. I just want to make sure you smell nice for Silly."

"Do I?", I ask as she begins to switch spots with 'Silly'.

"You have an enchanting musk," she replies.

Another set of fork-to-glass dings ring out.

"Ssssh," Celeste whispers. "Daemon's about to talk."

At the base of the enormous stairwell in the middle of the enormous ballroom, what looked like the center of the fucking universe, was a 50's-something man in a dark suit and a stern face. His silence caused a rippling silence around him. He looked important.

"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming out tonite." He spoke even more stern than his appearance. "It is an honor to be surrounded by so many bright and talented individuals. I hope you all checked in."

The ballroom burst into laughter. I laughed too, but then again, I was almost really drunk at that point so I would have laughed at anything.

"We made Foursquare for one purpose: to know each other better. I will credit myself with the idea, and you all with making that dream a reality. An idea is just an idea, but a dream is..."

God knows what else he said after that. A few minutes later, a woman, possibly his assistant, handed him a drink while he spoke. He wrapped up his speech. "Foursquare is not just an app, it is an--"

*Eeeeeeeeeeeeeevillllll eeeeeeeevvvvillllllll*

"What the fuck was that?!" I involuntarily belted, luckily only loud enough for a couple of people around me to look at me funny. I swore I heard a screeching Golem-like voice trounce whatever the host was saying. Nobody else reacted. I shook off the shiver that trickled up and down my spine.

Everyone rose their glass. I must've missed the last bit. Everyone cheersed and clapped and clapped. I followed suit and raised my glass to hide whatever just happened. I wanted to see Daemon's face one more time, so I kept tilting my head left and right to get a glimpse of him again, but there were so many people in the way.

And then, bam. I saw him. He was staring right at me. The next moment he was hidden behind the thickness of the crowd. I was drunk, and trippin'. I turned to converse with the girls once again, and thank goodness they were still there. They were both talking to different people. Celeste noticed I was staring at her, probably drunkenly as hell. I needed a drink. She did the 'one moment' motion to the gentleman she was talking to and walked over to me a few feet away. She put her hand along my chin and said something to me that sounded so sweet and nice, words I didn't deserve at that moment, not sure what she said though. The last thing I remember was her slowly bringing her hand over my eyes and that was it. The rest of the night was a blur.

*     *     *

I woke up in my car. It was morning. And there was puke on my leg. I was parked on the street a distance from the mansion. Nobody was around. The mansion looked bleak and empty. I wondered what had happened the rest of the night, and how I got back to my car. I didn't, however, wonder why there was puke on my leg. I felt my pockets for my necessities. Keys, phone, rolling tobacco, wallet. Everything was there. I was stoked. I needed coffee.

The drive into the nearby wine country town was peaceful. It was 9am and the town was bustling with the usual weekend brunch crowd and cheese enthusiasts. I parked in front of a little café called Hunter's End, which sounded appropriate since I had been hunting and it did end. I ordered my usual black coffee, with a simple croissant to soak up the remaining alcohol still floating around in my gut.

I pulled out my phone in hopes that it would narrate what had happened the night before. There were no pictures or text messages or phone calls or new phone numbers. Then I looked in the notes section of my phone, where I would sometimes jot down reminders for blacked out occasions just like this. There was one line. It read, "Cele red dress frend is meldy". It started coming back to me, Celeste and her friend Melody. But no phone number. I was disappointed.

I finished my breakfast and hopped in my car. The small town café was cool enough to remember, so I opened Foursquare. And there she was. "Celestival". I had her. It wasn't a complete loss! I turned on my Elvis, rolled a spliff, rolled up my sleeves, rolled down my windows, and drove happily home.
