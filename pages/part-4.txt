"Wow, your eye," Britten said. "It's all jacked up."

"Thanks," I said.

"Have you set up the light client yet? We need it for our test net."

"No it's still really fat," I said. "Britten, listen to me. This is bigger than we think. Something extra ordinary is happening."

She points up. "Meteors in the sky all the time?" About a dozen meteor streaks scored the afternoon sky, which became a normal occurrence.

I told Britten about the little incident with Celeste, and I could tell she had begun to lose faith.

I checked in just as Francis called. "What up Francis?"

"I got it, what you told me to get. From her phone," he said.

"That's grouch. How?" I leaned toward Britten and told her "I gotta bounce." She nodded and waved me away.

"I just plugged in that thing you gave me just like you said and I think it downloaded everything," he said.

He explained how the opportunity arose when Melody's phone had slipped from her pocket while he was taking her home. Before bringing it back, he downloaded everything off her phone and got exactly what I needed. Francis had been seeing Melody for a few days now. It was unprecedented.

I raced home to meet Francis leaning on the picket fence in the front yard, dangling the device in his hand, not too happy.

"What's with the sadness?" I asked him.

"I don't know. It's pretty fucked up what I did," he said. He handed me the data. "Take this. I want to forget I ever did that."

"Thank you thank you!" I gave him a pat on the back and quickly walked inside.

*

It was a goldmine. Data queries, notes on algorithms, passwords stored in plain text. Stupid girl.

As I rifled through the data, it became even more confusing.  It dated a few weeks into the past and a few days into the future. Future data was marked with an 'Eclipse' that looked like probability ratios coupling each future action. Most blocks were marked as unlikely, and a few as near definite.

Most players had very repetitive blocks: from work to home, and back again. But it appeared even these simple lives were inticed with blocks ever so slightly off their beaten paths.

I projected the data onto Francis's cracked monitor to display it as a scrolling timeline. It looked like a puzzle, but it didn't feel like one. That flat crystal ball in front of me was stitching together our likely near future, and parts of it were shown through Raiden's stained blood.

Instead of walking down 4th street to work today, it suggested one player walk down 5th.

Another player would be persuaded to use 5th Street that morning as well. Its Eclipse was low, but if they both confirmed that block, they would then be led to a chain of high Eclipse blocks with their threads intertwined together through the maze, ending at her flat that night. And it was her place every block thereafter, all the way to the edge of where the new Eclipsed blocks were birthed.

Every moment that passed affected the data. It never went more than a couple of seconds without adjusting Eclipses, creating new blocks, or destroying failed ones. And when high eclipsed blocks were missed, it sent the laundry flying.

The fireworks from it being wrong were amusing. It would loop through countless drafts of possibilities in a dazzle of glittering threads rearranging in hopes of linking to a better path through the Eclipsed. But each of those changes caused resounding changes around it as far as the eye could see. This helpless fit could go on for minutes until it found a comfortable match, and then all was calm again.

My player was embarassing. It showed me going absolutely nowhere for days. How did it know?

*

"Yes you have it and its ready! That's what you're going to tell me, right?" Britten lit up with the falsest glee I had ever seen.

"Yes I do actually," I retorted.

Her eyes widened in disbelief. She prepared her plume over her notes. "Okay let's here it."

"It's like a million little fibers in the wind trying to catch grains of sand," I explained. "It's beautiful. It can--"

"In less idiot terms please," she remarked.

"They map out and cause fluxuations in these chains!"

"..."

"Our blocks, " I said motioning around us. "These blocks are chained together, sometimes combining, sometimes splitting. And it lights up like crazy when it's way off target." I did the best I could to explain what I thought the Eclipse ratios were and everything else I saw that night.

Her notes still didn't have a drop of ink on them. "Is it immutable? Do you have write access?"

"No, but," I began while I realized I did not know. I hadn't tried. "No. I don't."

*

I watched my tiny edit reach the top of the queue, and then disappear into the abyss.

>-$ block #4f3k8
$ confirmed
$ @ e0.900 -rf

Since I was still home as the next block suggested, that block was confirmed. It didn't mind that I overwrote an Eclipse from a 0.8 to a 0.9 and deleted some maximum constants there were getting in the way.

Every edit I made after that jumped in and sailed away, too. But they were all nearly inconsequential. I wanted to see it cry.

It was late into the night when I hit something unsettling. If I was reading it correctly, it said player melodic was going to arrive at our house to cross paths with player francix in a few minutes. A 0.4 Eclipse. Francis was asleep, though.

Several minutes later, nothing happened. I stood at the window of the war room atop the house waiting for some strangeness to occur. The streets were empty. I walked back to the screen and changed it to near definite.

The monitor's frantic glimmer pored over the accent chair, and I did too. I wanted to watch, but it was late and time for sleep.

*

The doorbell rang.

The doorbell rang again.

And again.

It was pouring rain in the middle of the night. Who would be at the door at this ungodly hour in this torrential storm?

I stumbled through the dark house to get to the front door. The door bell kept ringing.

I looked through the peep hole. It was Melody with somebody behind her at the bottom of the steps.

I opened the unlocked door. She was drenched from head to toe. Her signature eyeliner was dripping down her furious face.

She said something to me but the storm drowned out her words. Her soaked hair draped over her black dress, melting into it.

I couldn't understand what she said so I took a step outside to get closer.

I leaned toward her to hear her. Finally it was audible.

"You," she said in a deeper voice than her own. "You made a big mistake."

I looked behind her to see who her backup was. It was Francis. His state was cold and lifeless, part zombie, part vengeful.

The door bell rang again. And again. And again. I put my hand over the button to stop the ringing. Melody pressed her freezing ice cold hand against mine to force me to press it.

When I woke, it was still night. And there was a storm. My phone was ringing. By the time I went to answer it, the call had ended. It was Celeste.

Staring at my transparent reflection in the glass was supposed to change my mind, but it didn't. My blurry vision suggested I go back to sleep before I did anything unwise. I thought it was wrong, and then I thought I didn't care.

Come to me, I thought. That will be the test.

To simplify the data on the screen, I hid everything but my player's paths and those of player celestival.

*

I was hoping this was the place she told me to meet her. Her only remark was "at the place we skipped when we were walking in the rain". We skipped pebbles in a puddle when we were walking home from the bocci ball bar a few weeks ago so it was probably the place she was talking about.

I sat on the broken hitching rail near where that puddle might have been to the best of my recollection. Since the puddle was gone, I couldn't check in.

I swayed to keep balance while I lit my spliff. A hand was placed on my shoulder from behind me followed by "Hi don't take your phone out."

Celeste leaned against the post.

"OK," I said. She sounded serious.

"How is your spliff?" she asked.

"It's delicious," I said.

"How is your eye?" she dared ask.

"It doesn't hurt any more," I told her.

"It looks like shit. Look, I need to talk to you. Don't take out your phone."

"OK."

"I don't want them to know I'm here."

"Well your phone could probably be tracked easily."

"I left it at home dumb dumb. We're fine," she said.

"It's that easy huh?"

"It's that easy."

She taps on the rail rapidly. She perfects her posture and turns her body to face me. "I knew who you were before I met you."

"How romantic," I sarcast.

"They know about it," she says. "And they want you."

"Well I want them," I say, making sure my words are as ambiguous as hers. "Sounds like good news."

"No, it's not," she says. She nearly tears up. "This... This *thing*... has gotten out of hand."

"You need to understand something," she says. "Let's go for a walk."

“Apology accepted,” I say.

"It's about your app."

"Hmm," I say, both of us silent as I juggle whether to admit or deny what I'm sure she already knows about. "Yeah let's go for a walk."

We strolled atop the rolling green coastal hills without a cloud in sight, a place most frequented by kite enthusiasts and couples sharing sorbet. With her phone at home and mine left at my ride, I felt like we were free of our self-imposed matrix.

"What did you do before Foursquare?" I ask.

"I was working on something very similar to your app," she says. "Until I met Daemon."

"Where did you meet him?"

She giggles to herself and shakes her head. "In da club, you could say."

Figures. I smile and nod and made a spinning-around-the-pole motion with my finger.

"I didn't even use my real name!" she says.

She told me everything.

Daemon had read her white paper about people's personal information and social data mining. He somehow found her at da club, recruited her, and so began Foursquare's recommendation engine. It was heavily based on a person's daily patterns. Most people live simple, repetitive lives with only a few moveable levers to alter. Although a lot of the technical Calculus-intensive aspects of the algorithms went over my head, I clearly understood that its bullseye accuracy came from the subdlty of its suggestions; It offered the players a future that was only a hair different than their original fate. The delta between what the players wanted and what the code preferred, though, was creating a rift.

Very quickly the data learned its own accuracy, its 'Eclipse' of reality, and would act on that as well. Some people were easily influenced. Some were born influencers. And they all liked their virtual and real-world rewards. Its only known goal was to be more and more accurate, and its decisions were mostly left unchallenged. Then the algorithms grew to be vain. It learned that if reward encouraged people to follow its suggestions, then punishment for doing otherwise would do the same.

"People meeting at a location but not knowing who they're supposed to meet."

"Yeah," I say. "I usually don't know why I even listen to it."

"You’re what we call a fanatic," she says. "You fall for it so hard that you believe the science fiction we wrote."

"But it feels like a playful game."

"It was. Now it's different. I think it's planned out a future already," she explains. "And it's reaching for it."

"Did you create those mechaniques?"

"I'm the creator. Daemon's the instigator," she says. "Algorithms folding into algorithms." She shakes her head. "I've seen it choose from a million choices and it chooses freaky things now."

"Can't you just adjust it?"

"Not anymore!" she says. "Daemon won't let me.”

"I can," I say with a proud smirk.

"I know," she says back at me, cleaning that smirk off my face. "You have been, wrecklessly, and it's tearing apart at the seams."

"How so?"

"I know it sounds weird, but I think those aren't meteors," she says as she points at the lightly scored sky. "Those are rips. When what is supposed to happen doesn't, the hourglass gets shaken, violently."

"Hourglass, huh," I say with raised eyebrows, not really understanding her fantastical explanation.

"And now I think the hourglass is cracking," she says with a laugh. "Ugh, what am I saying?"

We take a seat on the grass near a small pond. "I have a picture from the future,” she says. “Wanna see?”

"Yeah for sure."

She takes out a Polaroid picture from her purse and hands it to me. It's me and her at a phone booth in the middle of nowhere.

"This has never happened," she says. "Not yet at least."

"Yeah I don't remember that at all. But I already have my black eye so it was recent. Maybe we both blacked out?"

"I haven't seen you in weeks."

"We used to be so close, kind of," I say. "What happened?"

She puts her hand on the side of my face, just like she did the first night I met her. "Andrew."

"Tell you the truth, I don't even know if this is happening right now," she says.

"I hope it is," I say.

*

I turned off the monitor and sat back down next to her. "What do you think?"

"I made that?" she giggled. We both laughed at the joke and then laughed that it was true. "I didn't know."

I wanted to wring every bit of knowledge out of that pretty head of hers, but I knew it was best to go at her pace. "What did you not know?"

"This projection," she started. "It was supposed to only reach out a block or two. This is infinite."

"There's a threshold that I can show you."

I began to turn on the glass when she asked, "What are you on?"

"I already told you that I won't tell you how I got my access," repeating words I had already said a couple of times.

"You're using a super user," she muttered. "Andrew, you're using the entire Foursquare fucking network as your sandbox!"

"I... what?"

"Look at this," she said. She underlined a single line on the screen. It read, 'Source: Network'.

"Every device running the app is, at this moment, Andrew," she said through heavy breaths. "Is being farmed to power the data on this very screen. I wrote it to use one player's device. It's based on processing power!" She tapped a couple of commands into the terminal and the timeline zoomed out drastically. "It's infinite."

"Nice," I said.

*

The faucet always leaked, but Celeste could never hear that everpresent metronome coming from downstairs.

"I still don't hear it!" she laughed. "Dammit I lost my place."

It always looked like we were looking at each other because we were looking at the same data on either side of the glass. Our fingers traced through the blocks like we were reaching for each other too.

"Says I'm going to fix that sink tomorrow, point 0 something," I said.

"It's not broken."

We met at the front door after she plucked her beach cloak from its hook. "It's in here." She pulled out two viles and cracked them both. "This one's for you." We were completely silent after that for the entire walk to the bay.

"The sand feels good, but cold," she said, covering her toes beneath it. "Yeah we need to make sure we don't burn out people's devices with this."

"Are your hands cold?" I asked.

She paused, then put her hands toward me and looked at them. I wrapped my fingers around to conceal hers from the wind.

"You're missing something," she said.

I looked down and saw her examining my wrist. The quick pull of my shirt jostled me back to the beach. Celeste was holding the spare button she had just yanked off my shirt. She then pulled a sharp pin from her hair and sliced into the neck of her blouse to release a single thread about her. "Ready," she said.

I held out my arm to expose the missing space on the cuff. She glided the end of the thread over her lips then through her needle. She could see through the twilight enough to weave the button in place. I began to move my arm away from her since the process was done but she pulled it back and placed my palm under her neck. She immediately continued the threading as before, because of course it would take more than one stitch to complete her mission.

Through and through the loops that single fabric string connected us. Her steady pattern was admirable at first, and then hypnotic. I dreamed it would take a million threaded punctures before she was satisfied.

She exhaled her final sighing sound, and she was done. She came up to my collar and smoothed its wrinkle. It caused her one last breath as she rest her head on my clavicle. I don’t know what happened after that.

*

How many minutes or days or weeks passed by, I wondered. That shit was strong. My fingers were still threaded through her tresses keeping them warm. The brisk morning breeze clenched her hair with my fist, just enough to wake her.

“Whoa that was fucking crazy,” she yelped with her head still resting on me. “Alright it’s cold let’s go home.”

**

The last few days of our travels flew by in an instant. There was usually enough time at the end of each day for us to skip rocks in the river or throw the ball around. We had been oddly responsible the entire trip, so we decided to take our last night to the limit. I arranged the blocks to guarantee it was a success in a, and after minutes of fits, it fit nicely.

"It's nighttime where I live right now," she said in a deep voice with a coy bat of her lashes. She was already waiting on the new bridge as I arrived, and casually acted like I was a stranger and she a whore, I think.

"Me too," I replied. "Let's go to sleep."

"No you dog," she quickly retorted. "We're doing gifts, remember?"

>block #4f3d9 $
confirmed $
@ e0.800 -rf $

We hugged and shook each other underneath that giant radio tower after being apart for many hours, and so that block was confirmed.

She had already set up our blanket and vino on the lush grass with a perfect view of where the light show would show. Being half a world away and surrounded by empty fields gave the night a weightless care.

"That's our queue. Okay, here's yours," she said as she produced a gadget once the lights began. She slipped it on my fingers and said, "Now you can tell time, and you can see how it works." I wore the skeleton watch like brass knuckles from that point forward.

"Yours is because you made it," I said.

"Put it on me," she says as I show her the double-chain necklace with a gold cube as the medallion.

She bows her head for me to do the honors. "You and I made this," I say. She stops my placement with both of her hands.

She twined the chain and her ponytail together to tighten the necklace as a headdress. "I'll wear it like this. Is there something inside of it?" she asked. "In the block?"

"There will be," I told her.

*


"Melody said you could," Celeste argued.

"Fine let's do it," I responded. She brought the wine glass to both of our lips and we finished it together.

"How much was in that?" I asked.

"Like four or more."

"That sounds like a lot," I said. I stood up and kicked the spheroid ball into her hand. "This stuff works quick so I'm gonna go deep before I can't!" She stood up while I began my route.

"Bullseye!" I exclaimed when I caught the ball after its second bounce and admired it. I studied the ball's eliptical edge and thought it was strange for a ball to be shaped to intentionally go in random directions. "Wow I've never seen such chaos in a--" I began when Celeste tackled me head on.

It took me a moment to realize I was flat on the turf and the ball was gone. Celeste was staring at me from above trying to smile while I was laying there trying to breathe. She undid her pony tale which caused her crown to become a necklace again. It rested on my neck as she brought herself closer to me.

There was a while that the only thing I could see was the emerald in her iris.

>-$ block #4f001

The truth could not overwhelm the perception. Was this universe all created to been seen by just my eyes? Am I her eyes? I tried to translate every detail in her kaleidoscopes, flickered by the occasional flutter of her eyelashes blinking. Everything in there was wonderful.

She arched her back enough to let her finger trace the incision on my chest. "Two," she whispered. "I can feel the green of the grass. I hear your warmth."

>block #4f033 $

We spoke of everything, from different pasts and other paths we had seen. We threw the ball around again, and enoyed more wine and cheese, and drew images in the grass, but in between everything we would end up right back just like this. It was a break from our fabricated reality we dosed ourselves with. It was a break from everything.

she draped the necklace down to her neck

"This is for this." I pulled the little trinket from my shirt pocket and put it to her necklace. She let her hair down and draped the necklace down to her neck."I found it in the wind over there." The rosey metal flower had its four pedals extending outside of the cube by the time I got it through, but it fit.

"Thank you," she said. "It's my crimoson clover. If nothing else, I'll remember this."

She snugged her ear against my neck and said a few things I could not hear. Then, "I’d rather be in no other place than right now."

"How did you know me before?" I asked her softly. She was asleep. She had been asleep for some time.

"Why now?" Britten said. "We're so close. Don't be afraid."

"Dont be afraid? I don't know when I'm sleeping or when I'm awake. I don't know what I'm seeing in front of me."

"This is your life's work. This is your kingdom come."

"It's like it's fighting back."

"Then stop adjusting outcomes!"

"What?"

"The, you told me... um, when you were wasted," she says. "I mean, you're--" both our phones chirp with a message about a meteor warning from the city, telling us to head inside. "Um, OK we need to head out." She gets up and abruptly grabs her leather jacket off the back of her chair. "We'll continue this later. I'll call you."

"Cool," I say. "So I'll catch you later?" I spin my phone between my fingers and notice she's looking at it intently.

Then she looks into my eyes with deep concern. "Be careful. Seriously." She puts her hands on my shoulders and takes a deep breath. "OK?" She gives me a tight hug goodbye and walks away without looking at me.

I quickly pull up my backdoor entrance to Foursquare's database and search for her account. Her next rec has those strange characters I remember seeing on Celeste's history. Weird shit would happen when I would do Force Queries, but my curiosity got the best of me. I looked up and she was still in sight about a block away.

I flipped her Eclipse to the opposite and inverse, and submitted.

I waited a few seconds for it to register, what felt like an eternity, while I stared at her white girl prance continue away from me. Ding. She took her phone out and looked at it. Then she turned around and looked at me.
