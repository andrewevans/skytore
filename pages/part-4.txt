"Wow, your eye," Britten said. "It's all jacked up."

"Foursquare," I said. "Gave me a shiner."

"Um, OK. Did she give you any more clues?"

I point at my eye. "This may have been the last clue."

"Dammit Andrew. We *need* her," she said. "What did you do?"

"A girl died a few nights ago and I saw her injuries on my squarecam before it happened," I explained. "Britten, listen to me. This is bigger than we think. Something extra ordinary is happening."

She points up. "Meteors in the sky 24/7?" About a dozen meteor streaks scored the afternoon sky, which became a normal occurrence.

I told Britten about the little incident with Celeste, and I could tell she had begun to lose faith.

My phone rang with a picture of a foot. "What up Francis?"

"Dude I got it."

"Got what?" I asked.

"What you told me to get. From her phone," he mumbled.

"Oh hell yeah. How?" I leaned toward Britten and told her "I gotta bounce." She nodded and motioned that she was going to stay.

"I just plugged in that thing you gave me just like you said and I think it downloaded everything," he said.

He explained how the opportunity arose when Melody's phone had slipped out of her pocket in his car while he was driving her home. Before bringing it back to her, he downloaded everything off her phone and got exactly what I needed. Francis had been seeing Melody for a few days now. It was unprecedented.

I raced home to meet Francis leaning on the picket fence in the front yard, dangling the device in his hand, not too happy.

"What's with the sadness?" I asked him.

"I don't know. It's pretty fucked up what I did," he said. He handed me the data. "Take this. I want to forget I ever did that."

"Thank you thank you!" I gave him a pat on the back and quickly walked inside.

It was a goldmine; data queries, notes on algorithms, passwords stored in plain text. Stupid girl.

As I rifled through the data, it became even more confusing.  It dated back a few years into the past and a few days into the future. Future data was marked as 'Eclipse' with what looked like probability ratios coupling each future action. Most were marked as unlikely, but some were marked as near definite.

Most players had very repetitive blocks. If they're at work, their next location is home. If they're at home, they're either going to the liquor store or back to work.

The town cooper will go to the lumber mill. And then go to his shed, then go home.

Two strangers will likely meet by happenstance at a dog park tomorrow and go to the nearby bistro with their mutts. Their next steps are not clear.

A group of players have a slight chance of crossing paths on the same street corner at high noon tomorrow. That improbable block was chained to its next block with a very sure 0.9 Eclipse that they would all go to jail minutes after meeting at that corner.

I avoided looking at my player's data for fear that it could alter the universe. A couple minutes later I decided that wasn't the case and dove in.

Mine was embarassing. It showed me going absolutely nowhere for the next three days. How did it know?

I projected the data onto Francis's cracked monitor in a scrolling timeline. It lit up the room as blocks would chain and unchain from each other in hopes to outmaneuver more accurately through the maze. It didn't feel like a game, though. That flat crystal ball in front of me was mapping the most likely near future. Raiden's stained blood on its facade also added an effect to it.

"Yes you have it! That's what you're going to tell me, right?" Britten lit up with the falsest glee I have ever seen.

"Yes I do actually," I retorted.

Her eyes widened in disbelief. "Okay let's here it."

"It's like a million little fibers in the wind trying to catch grains of sand," I explained. "It's beautiful. It can--"

"In less idiot terms please," she remarked.

"They map out and cause fluxuations in these chains!"

""

I wished she could have been in on this with me. She would have loved it.

*

I turned on the glass and the lights dazzled once again.

*

*

The data was enormous. It was late into the night when I hit something unsettling. If I was reading it correctly, it said 'Melodic' was going to arrive at our house to cross paths with Francix in a few minutes. A 0.4 Eclipse. Francis was asleep, though.

Several minutes later, nothing.

I stood at the window of the war room atop the house waiting for some strangeness to occur. The streets were empty.

It was late and time for sleep.

*

The doorbell rang.

The doorbell rang again.

And again.

It was pouring rain in the middle of the night. Who would be at the door at this ungodly hour in this torrential storm?

I stumbled through the dark house to get to the front door. The door bell kept ringing.

I looked through the peep hole. It was Melody with somebody behind her at the bottom of the steps.

I opened the unlocked door. She was drenched from head to toe. Her signature eyeliner was dripping down her furious face.

She said something to me but the storm drowned out her words. Her soaked hair draped over her black dress, melting into it.

I couldn't understand what she said so I took a step outside to get closer.

I leaned toward her to hear her. Finally it was audible.

"You," she said in a deeper voice than her own. "You made a big mistake."

I looked behind her to see who her backup was. It was Francis. His state was cold and lifeless, part zombie, part vengeful.

The door bell rang again. And again. And again. I put my hand over the button to stop the ringing. Melody pressed her freezing ice cold hand against mine to force me to press it.

When I woke, it was still night. And there was a storm. My phone was ringing. By the time I went to answer it, the call had ended. It was Celeste.

I was hoping this was the place. She told me to meet her. Her only remark was "at the place we threw rocks at when we were walking in the rain". We threw some pebbles at a McDonalds sign when we were walking home from the bocci ball bar a few weeks ago so it was probably the place she was talking about.

I grabbed a seat near the front door and ate my McChicken McSandwich as I waited. I thought it best to not check in at this establishment for several reasons.

A hand was placed on my shoulder from behind me followed by "Hi don't take your phone out."

Celeste sat down in the seat next to me.

"OK," I said. She sounded serious.

"How is your sandwich?" she asked.

"It's delicious," I said.

"How is your eye?" she dared ask.

"It doesn't hurt any more," I told her.

"It looks like shit. Look, I need to talk to you. Don't take out your phone."

"OK."

I don't want my work to know I'm here."

"Well your phone could probably be tracked easily."

"I left it at home dumb dumb. We're fine," she said.

"It's that easy huh?"

"It's that easy."

She taps on the table rapidly. She perfects her posture and turns her body to face me. "I knew who you were before I met you."

"How romantic," I sarcast.

"They know about it," she says. "And they want you."

"Well I want them," I say, making sure my words are as ambiguous as hers. "Sounds like good news."

"No, it's not," she says. She nearly tears up. "This... This *thing*... has gotten out of hand."

"You need to understand something," she says. "Let's go for a walk."

“Apology accepted,” I say.

"It's about your app."

"Hmm," I say, both of us silent as I juggle whether to admit or deny what I'm sure she already knows about. "Yeah let's go for a walk."

“We need to work together on this,” she says.

We strolled through Scrolls Park's rolling green hills without a cloud in sight, a place most frequented by kite enthusiasts and couples sharing ice cream cones. With her phone at home and mine in my car, I felt like we were free of our self-imposed Matrix.

"What did you do before FourSquare?" I ask.

"I was working on something very similar to your app," she says. "Until I met Daemon."

"Where did you meet him?"

She giggles to herself and shakes her head. "In da club, you could say."

Figures. I smile and nod and made a spinning-around-the-pole motion with my finger.

"You got it!" she says.

She told me everything.

Daemon had read her white paper about people's personal information and social data mining. He found her at da club, recruited her, and so began Foursquare's recommendation engine. It was heavily based on a person's daily patterns. Most people live simple, repetitive lives with only a few moveable levers to alter. Although a lot of the technical Calculus-intensive aspects of the algorithms went over my head, I still clearly understood that its bullseye accuracy came from the subdlty of its suggestions; It would create overlapping groupings of peers, and then offer them up future collective actions that were only a hair different than their original fate.

Very quickly the data learned its own accuracy, its 'Eclipse' of reality, and would act on that as well. Some people were easily influenced. Some were born influencers. And they all liked their virtual and real-world rewards. Its only known goal was to be more and more accurate, and its decisions were mostly left unchallenged. Then the algorithms grew to be vain. It learned that if reward encouraged people to follow its suggestions, then punishment for doing otherwise would do the same.

"People meeting at a location but not knowing who they're supposed to meet."

"Yeah," I say. "I usually don't know why I even listen to it."

"You’re what we call a fanatic," she says. "You fall for it so hard that you believe the science fiction we wrote."

"But it feels like a playful game."

"It was. Now it's different. I think it's planned out a future already," she explains. "A really bad one. And it's reaching for it."

"Did you create those mechaniques?"

"I'm the creator, but he's the instigator," she says. "Algorithms folding into algorithms." She shakes her head. "I've seen it choose from a million choices and it chooses freaky things now."

"Can't you just adjust it?"

"Not anymore!" she says. "Daemon won't let me.”

"I can," I say with a proud smirk.

"I know," she says back at me, cleaning that smirk off my face. "You have been, wrecklessly, and it's tearing apart at the seams."

"How so?"

"I know it sounds weird, but I think those aren't meteors," she says as she points at the scored sky. "Those are rips. When what is supposed to happen doesn't, the hourglass gets shaken, violently."

"Hourglass, huh," I say with raised eyebrows, not really understanding her fantastical explanation.

"And now I think the hourglass is cracking," she says with a laugh. "Ugh, what am I saying?"

We take a seat on the grass near a small pond. "I have a picture from the future,” she says. “Wanna see?”

"Yeah for sure."

She takes out a Polaroid picture from her purse and hands it to me. It's me and her at a phone booth in the middle of nowhere.

"This has never happened," she says. "Not yet at least."

"Yeah I don't remember that at all. But I already have my black eye so it was recent. Maybe we both blacked out?"

"I haven't seen you in weeks."

"We used to be so close, kind of," I say. "What happened?"

She puts her hand on the side of my face, just like she did the first night I met her. "Andrew."

"Tell you the truth, I don't even know if this is happening right now," she says.

"I hope so," I say.

Every time we traveled, the routine was the same. I would read the paper in the lobby of her hotel until she came in. She would loudly ask the bellhop where she could get the shittiest baguette. Whatever his response was, that's where we would meet.

"It was amazing," she told me while breaking off another crumbled pull of burnt bread. "I wish you were there. You would have loved it."

"Did you."

We sit down in the grass near a small duck pond.

"OK I need you to concentrate. Ask Foursquare what you should do next."

I do as I'm told. My heart starts racing. Is this a set up?

"Change its Eclipse to the opposite and inverse. You'll have to do a Force Query."

"That's risky," I say. "Someone might notice my change on the diff. But OK." Foursquare suggests I 'skip rocks in the pond' with an Eclipse of .8. I change the Eclipse to its negative inverse, -1/.8, and submit the change to Foursquare via a Force Query. A few seconds pass. The update updates the entire database's recommendations, and my new rec shows on the screen.

"Notice anything?"

"It says lay down with a flower and enjoy the sun." She nods and motions me to do that. I take the flower from behind her ear as she leads me to lay down in the grass.

I lay down. She lays down next to me and holds on to me tightly. "It's a nice day," I say. It gets brighter and brighter then a sharp flash of light --

"... it what you should do next. Then change its Eclipse to the opposite and inverse."

I'm sitting upright. Celeste is too.

"You'll have to do a Force Query," she tells me.

"Thats risky. Someone might notice a... Wait. What. Wait."

"Notice anything?" she asks.

"Uhh."

*** he needs to do the force query again.

"What happened?"

"It says... lay down with a flower and enjoy the sun." I take the flower from behind her ear then lay down and she too. She holds on to me tightly. "It feels like I’ve already..." It gets brighter and brighter then a sharp flash of light--

"...what you should do next," she says.

We're sitting upright again.

"I think I'm going to be sick," I say.

"Why now?" Britten said. "We're so close. Don't be afraid."

"Dont be afraid? I don't know when I'm sleeping or when I'm awake. I don't know what I'm seeing in front of me."

"This is your life's work. This is your kingdom come."

"It's like it's fighting back."

"Then stop adjusting outcomes!"

"What?"

"The, you told me... um, when you were wasted," she says. "I mean, you're--" both our phones chirp with a message about a meteor warning from the city, telling us to head inside. "Um, OK we need to head out." She gets up and abruptly grabs her leather jacket off the back of her chair. "We'll continue this later. We need to go over your compass thing. I'll call you."

"Cool," I say. "So I'll catch you later?" I spin my phone between my fingers and notice she's looking at it intently.

Then she looks into my eyes with deep concern. "Be careful. Seriously." She puts her hands on my shoulders and takes a deep breath. "OK." She gives me a tight hug goodbye and walks away without looking at me.

I quickly pull up my backdoor entrance to Foursquare's database and search for her account. Her next rec has those strange characters I remember seeing on Celeste's history. Weird shit would happen when I would do Force Queries, but my curiosity got the best of me. I looked up and she was still in sight about a block away.

--- that's fucked up to adjust someone's future knowing that its often a bad outcome---

I flipped her Eclipse to the opposite and inverse, and submitted.

I waited a few seconds for it to register, what felt like an eternity, while I stared at her white girl prance continue away from me. Ding. She took her phone out and looked at it. Then she turned around and looked at me.
